# MLP-on-Image-Dataset

This work aims at the implemention of a Multi-layer Perceptron, i.e., a two layer neural network, using NumPy over a image dataset.

The key  feaatures of the model are as follows:
1. Implemention of dense and sigmoid activation layers
2. Building and designing of Neural Network architectures containing dense layers and sigmoid activation
3. Processing and forwarding the images through the Neural Network
4. Computation of the binary cross-entropy loss for measuring the Network's prediction error
